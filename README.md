# Camthing — A Minimal, Customizable Camera App


- 🖼️ **Live camera preview** using `AVCaptureSession`
- ⏸️ **Pause / resume** functionality
- 📷 **Capture photos** and save to library
- ⚙️ Modular architecture (`CameraManager`, `CameraContainerView`)

- ✅ Built using SwiftUI + UIKit interoperability

**Purpose of Building this: **
I wanted a clean, modular camera UI in SwiftUI that I could use in future projects — something simple enough to understand and customize, but powerful enough to build on.


**Example Usage: **

CameraContainerView { manager in
    CameraOverlay(manager: manager)
}
