# Camthing â€” A Minimal, Camera App

**Camthing** is a lightweight, SwiftUI-friendly camera interface designed to be **clean**, **reusable**, and **production-ready** for iOS apps.  
Built using **SwiftUI + UIKit**, itâ€™s simple to customize and extend â€” perfect for both prototypes and real-world camera tools.


- Live camera preview using `AVCaptureSession`
- Pause / resume support
- Capture and save photos to photo library
- Modular architecture (`CameraManager`, `CameraContainerView`)
- Easily toggle:
  - Camera position (front/back)
  - Resolution (`.hd1920x1080`, `.hd1280x720`, etc.)
  - Flash mode (`on`, `off`, `auto`)
  - Frame rate (24, 30, 60, 120 fps)
  - Zoom level
  - Mirror output (for selfies)
- Built with SwiftUI + UIKit for full hardware access + modern UI

## Why I Built This

At **Answers**, we were running into serious **CPU usage issues** with our in-app camera â€” leading to performance drops and (more than a few) crashes.

Looking for a better foundation, I explored Appleâ€™s official camera demo app â€” but most of its APIs are **iOS 18+ only**, making it impractical for real-world apps.

> For a camera-based app, requiring iOS 18+ is a non-starter.

So I built my own:

- ðŸ’¡ A **clean, modular** camera UI
- ðŸ’¡ SwiftUI-compatible
- ðŸ’¡ iOS **16+** support
- ðŸ’¡ Easy to drop into future projects

Sid, if you're reading this â€” the README is kinda fire. My goal: a minimal but powerful camera base I could trust and iterate on across projects.


**Example Usage:**

CameraContainerView { manager in
    CameraOverlay(manager: manager)
}
